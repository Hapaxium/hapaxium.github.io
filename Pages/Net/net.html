    <h2>What's up with the Flat Earthers?</h2>

      I scour the web from time to time for weird and inane shit. If you participate at all in the Internet, you have at least heard of the "Flat Earth" movement over the last year or so. I'm sure it has been around longer than that, but the "movement" has really penetrated popular culture within the last cycle or two around the flat earth.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
      I began my descent down the rabbit hole a few months ago when I joined a private Facebook group- "Flat Earth- No Trolls". I wasn't much of a troll because mostly I just lurked. As long as I didn't participate, I could hang around and check out all the things the FlEarthers were discussing. The posts were captivating- mostly because of how unbelievably stupid they were. I was in absolute shock, although I guess I shouldn't have been, because the majority of people in the group could barely spell, let alone use grammar in any meaningful sense.

      From this group, I joined another. And another. And I became familiar with their digital hubs outside Facebook, like the Flat Earth Society's website. There is a verifiably <em>strong</em> following in this community. It is undeniable. Thousands of people are calling themselves flat earthers- even professional ball throwers and sport-guys. What the hell is happening in America (and beyond)?! I think there are many avenues to approach this epidemic of stupidity from, but here's mine:

      We have known the world was round, or at least had a pretty strong suspicion, since the times of the ancient greeks. I didn't know this before learning about FE. This is actually true- way back in the dawn of civilization, there was this dude named Aristarchus of Samos who noticed that ships disappeared bottom-first on the horizon. This man decided to measure the distance and angles of sun-dials at different latitudes. He traveled north and south, all across the ancient world, meticulously recording his measurements all the while. When he was finished, he used some nifty geometry and arithmetic to deduce the approximate size of the Earth. He concluded that it must be rounded in shape, and he actually got within something like a few percentage points of the true circumference of our planet. This was all 4,000 years ago.

      So, how does it come to be that in the year 2018, with access to the internet, immense education, and the compiled knowledge of 4 millenia to our advantage, that we somehow have become even stupider than our most distant ancestors? I think the answer lies in the erosion of our education system, rooted in a neoliberal, free-market system, and secondly, in the dogmatic nature of the American brand of Judeo-Christian religiosity.
