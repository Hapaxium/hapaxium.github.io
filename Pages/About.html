        Welcome to Hapaxium- a library of my thoughts and ideas. Hapaxium derives from Hapax, which is an old greek word short for <i>Hapax Legomenon</i> (the definition is on the front page).<br />

        A few years ago, I chose the word "Hapax" as my digital alias for no other reason other than I thought it was "cool." "Hapaxium" felt more like a place- a website. I intend to use this tiny corner of the Internet to catalog the thoughts of myself and a few friends.<br />

        I don't profess to be an expert in anything I comment on, nor do my friends, probably. This project is not motivated by a sense of self-importance or the idea that our thoughts are somehow of any value to society (I indulge my narcissism in other ways, however- be assured).

        This project is mainly motivated by our desire to create something that will last, something that can be (perhaps) accessed by future peoples in times and places that we cannot even begin to comprehend. Do I really need to justify it any more than that... I mean, that's pretty cool in and of itself- right?

        Men used to paint on the walls of caves or carve symbols into chunks of stone. We have decided to slog through some basic HTML and CSS in order to build this place with our own hands (or fingers) for the same basic purpose as our ancient ancestors- we just wish to be known.
