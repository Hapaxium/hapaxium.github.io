        Welcome to Hapax- a library of my thoughts and ideas. Hapax is an old greek word, short for <i>Hapax Legomenon</i> (the definition is on the front page).<br />

      </p>

      <p>
        I chose the word as my digital alias for no other reason other than I thought it was "cool." I intend to use this tiny corner of the Internet to catalog my thoughts, to mark my existence in the unfathomable vastness that comprise the space and time in which we exist.<br />

      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what you will find on this site are the unedited, extemporaneous writings of myself and, occasionally, my friends. I don't profess to be an expert in anything I comment on, and this project is not motivated by my sense of self-importance or the idea that my thoughts are somehow of any value to society (I indulge my narcissism in other ways, however- be assured).
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Not narcissism, then, but posterity. This project is mainly motivated by my desire to create something that will last, something that can be (perhaps) accessed by future peoples in times and places that I cannot even begin to comprehend. Do I really need to justify it any more than that... I mean, that's pretty cool in and of itself- right?

        Men used to paint on the walls of caves or carve symbols into chunks of stone. I've decided to slog my way through basic HTML and CSS in order to build this place with my own hands (or fingers) for the same basic purpose as my distant forebears- to be known.
        <br />...(or, alternatively, to curry favor with fertility gods so that my progeny might swell).
